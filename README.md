# IBM-Python-Project-for-Data-Science
A Python project for extracting stock data (Tesla &amp; GameStop) using yfinance and web scraping (BeautifulSoup), and visualizing the revenue data through a dashboard.

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate** program. The goal is to extract essential stock and revenue data from various sources and visualize it to help make data-driven decisions.

- Extracted stock data for **Tesla** and **GameStop** using the `yfinance` library.
- Used **Web Scraping** (`BeautifulSoup`) to extract historical revenue data from web pages.
- Cleaned and processed the data using **Pandas**.
- Created a dashboard and visualized stock prices vs. revenue using **Matplotlib** (and/or Plotly) to analyze financial trends.


## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping.
- **yfinance**: For fetching stock market data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment.
